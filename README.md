## AI Image Generation

AI image generation is a technology that uses deep learning algorithms to generate new images that are similar to a given set of images. This can be used to generate images of objects, scenes, or even people that do not exist in the real world. AI image generation can be used for a variety of applications, such as creating new images for video games or movies, or generating images for scientific research.

## Note

You have to configure your openAI API key and MongoDB url in config file
